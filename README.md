# Angular Firebase Seed

## Purpose

After working on several Angular + Firebase projects we got some experience of how to properly structure such a project. All pain, wasted hours and broken keyboards as well as best practices and reusable components and modules are concentrated in this repo.

Idea is to clone this project when we need to work on our next project/hackathon/pet project/anything. This repo contains minimum of features, but most of reusable stuff from project to project.

## Implementation

This app is a ToDo list app on muscles.

List of features:
* Realtime lists of todos - like Google Keep
* Group access - invite your friends and cowork on your lists together
* Share a list of todos to a person outside of your group or make it public
* Transfer ownership of a personal list to a group and visa versa
* Upload a txt/csv file with a list of todos
* Manage your personal account - avatar, email, oAuth providers, groups memberships
* Manage group account - avatar, members, accesses
